Always choose the simplest solution possible. 
Never use CCXT or any third-party exchange wrappers. 
Interact directly with official exchange APIs, (e.g., via official SDKs or REST/Websocket endpoints) to ensure full control and compliance. 
Always fetch real data from the exchange, 
never use dummy balance even in Forward testing paper mode. 
No hardcoded values, all variables (API keys, pairs, thresholds, etc.) must be in .env. Load with dotenv.
